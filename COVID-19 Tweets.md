## Inspiration
Exploring the emotional changes during the COVID-19 pandemic would be helpful during this period. 

## What it does
This project would visualize people's emotions in three categories, positive, negative, and neutral.

## How we built it
Used an existing GitHub repo for the corpus, and used NLTK for analysis. 

## Challenges we ran into
1. How to get the most recent tweets.
2. How to get the emotional change of a user.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We successfully visualize the data. 

## What we learned
1. NLTK 
2. Text processing by removing punctuation, stopwords, etc.

## What's next for ASAP
We want to build an instantaneous emotional track system. Maybe track the emotion of every user as well.
